Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB),CCRB: Average Days for the Police Department to Close Substantiated CCRB Cases  2005 - 2009,Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB)complaint activity data  2005-2009.  The time it takes the NYPD to resolve substantiated cases is measured from the date that the CCRB physically transferred the case file to the department until the last day of the month in which the department closed the case. The department does not inform the CCRB of its actual disposition date —just the month in which it closed the case. In addition  when the Department Advocate's Office refers a case to a commanding officer for the imposition of a command discipline  the NYPD considers the case closed and reports that closure to the CCRB. It is subsequent to this closure date that the commanding officer decides upon a penalty consistent with the level of command discipline proscribed by the Department Advocate's Office. For cases that proceeded to administrative hearings  the time it takes for judges to render written decisions is included in calculating the department's closure time.

Department of Education (DOE),School Safety Report,Since 1998  the New York City Police Department (NYPD) has been tasked with the collection and maintenance of crime data for incidents that occur in New York City public schools. The NYPD has provided this data for the 2010-2011 school year to the New York City Department of Education (DOE)  covering the period from July 1  2010-June 30  2011. The DOE has compiled this data by schools and locations for the information of our parents and students  our teachers and staff  and the general public.   In some instances  several Department of Education learning communities co-exist within a single building. In other instances  a single school has locations in several different buildings. In either of these instances  the data presented here is aggregated by building location rather than by school  since safety is always a building-wide issue. We use “consolidated locations” throughout the presentation of the data to indicate the numbers of incidents in buildings that include more than one learning community.,Education,qybk-bjjc,address,avgofmajor_n,avgofnocrim_n,avgofoth_n,avgofprop_n,avgofvio_n,borough,building_code,dbn,engroupa,geographical_district_code,id,location_code,location_name,major_n,nocrim_n,oth_n,prop_n,rangea,register,schools,schools_in_building,vio_n

Records contain 2010 College-bound seniors mean SAT scores.     Records with 5 or fewer students are suppressed (marked ‘s’).     College-bound seniors are those students that complete the SAT Questionnaire when they register for the SAT and identify that they will graduate from high school in a specific year. For example  the 2010 college-bound seniors are those students that self-reported they would graduate in 2010. Students are not required to complete the SAT Questionnaire in order to register for the SAT.

Department of Education (DOE),NYS Math Test Results By Grade 2006-2011 - School Level - All Students,New York City Results on the New York State Mathematics Tests  Grades 3 - 8  Notes:  As of 2006  the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously  state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3  5  6  and 7.  In 2006  NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011  District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.  Starting in 2010  NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels  increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

Department of Education (DOE),NYC School Survey - 2011,Every year  all parents  all teachers  and students in grades 6 - 12 take the NYC School Survey. The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally.     Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations  communication  engagement  and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement.     The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn.     New York City parents  students  and teachers reached new all-time participation highs on the 2011 School Survey. 960 191 surveys were submitted.,Education,mnz3-dyi8,

In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas  another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation  Regents Diploma  or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010  only one year of results is reported  separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August.   ¶•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed.   ¶•August outcomes include all June and August graduates.   ¶•In school-level reporting  students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort  but are included in citywide totals.   ¶•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools  but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.   ¶•Schools that had previously obtained a waiver to use alternative assessments (rather than Regents examinations) were omitted from the Math/ELA APM calculations.,Education,k8hv-56d7,_of_cohort_august,_of_cohort_june,dbn,demographic,name,total_cohort_august,total_cohort_june,total_math_ela_apm_august,total_math_ela_apm_june

Department of Education (DOE),2006-07 Class Size - By District,Citywide Class Size Report  including District  Program  Grade or Service Category.    SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)  #Grade 9 not in high schools  ##Indicates how special class is delivered    For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school)  class size is reported by four program areas: general education  special education self-contained class  collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category  which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.     The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools  bridge classes which span more than one grade  classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide  borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school)  class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English  Math  Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation  class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs  class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example  there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students  a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students  and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.     The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school.

Department of Education (DOE),School Progress Reports - All Schools - 2007-08,2007/08 Progress Report results for all schools (data as of 1/13/09)    Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g.  Elementary  K-8  Middle  High)    1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL  % SpEd  % Title I free lunch  and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.    2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools  we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools  we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores  % SpEd  and % Overage.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.    3) Schools for Transfer Students - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  We use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores and the % Overage/Under credited.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need.

Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category  which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.     The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools  bridge classes which span more than one grade  classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide  borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school)  class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English  Math  Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation  class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs  class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example  there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students  a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students  and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students.

Department of Education (DOE),NYC School Survey - 2009,Every year  all parents  all teachers  and students in grades 6 - 12 take the NYC School Survey. The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally.     Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations  communication  engagement  and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement.     The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. The NYC School Survey has been taken annually since its inception in 2007.,Education,ksfe-nc8x,

Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category  which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.     The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools  bridge classes which span more than one grade  classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide  borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school)  class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English  Math  Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation  class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs  class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example  there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students  a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students  and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.     The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers  including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers  “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science  and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.,Education,w49k-mmkh,average_class_size,grade_or_service_category_,program

Department of Education (DOE),2006-07 Class Size - By Region,Citywide Class Size Report  including Region  Program  Grade or Service Category.    SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)  #Grade 9 not in high schools  ##Indicates how special class is delivered    For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school)  class size is reported by four program areas: general education  special education self-contained class  collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category  which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade.     The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools  bridge classes which span more than one grade  classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide  borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school)  class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English  Math  Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation  class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs  class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program.

Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),Landcover Raster Data (2010),High resolution land cover data set for New York City.  This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy  (2) grass/shrub  (3) bare earth  (4) water  (5) buildings  (6) roads  and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary  building footprints  water  parking lots  roads  railroads  railroad structures  ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties  while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone  texture  pattern  location  size  and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35 000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such  it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF)  although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.  The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory  in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station  with funding from the USDA Forest Service.,Environment,9auy-76zt,
Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),NYC Urban Tree Canopy Assessment Metrics 2010,Tree Canopy (TC) Assessment metrics for New York City.  This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.    The TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC).     Existing TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.      Possible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy  not water  not a building  and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that  through modification  could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots  driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation  primarily grass or shrubs  which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather  the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.       TC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example  an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13 677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13 677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.    The TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals.,Environment,hnxz-kkn5,

Law Department (LAW),LAW Public Service Program,Early in his tenure at the Law Department  Corporation Counsel Michael A. Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms  where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on  in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department  it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public.   Trial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials  selecting juries  examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.  Law Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house  giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences  settlement negotiations  depositions  and  ultimately  trials.  Deposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.,City-Government,yk6f-pa7p,firms_donating_services_since_2007

The NYC Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (NYC OLTPS) and the City of New York assume no responsibility for the accuracy of this data or its suitability for any purposes. All users should independently verify the accuracy of the data for their purposes. This data on 1-in-100 year flood zones for New York City with Projected Sea Level Rise was produced by the Institute for Sustainable Cities  City University of New York for an analysis of large geographic areas only. 1.	Methods and Caveat – The projected flood extents included in this data reflect a “bathtub” methodology whereby a flood elevation is extrapolated landward until it reaches the equivalent contour height on land. This approach does not account for cumulative effects of soils  vegetation  surface permeability  bathymetry  infrastructure and beach structures  friction  and other factors that affect the movement of floodwaters resulting in local variations in flooding extent. 2.	Error – Numerous sources of potential error are present in the data. These include limitations of model input and scope (climate and FEMA floodplain models)  error inherent in model output  errors in and coarseness of topography  the rounding of base flood elevations to the nearest foot  and in GIS technique. 3.	Interpretation - The floodplains delineated in this data do not represent precise flood boundaries but rather illustrate two distinct areas of interest: A) areas that do not currently flood but are expected to potentially do so in the future and B) areas that do not currently flood and are unlikely to do so in the timeline of this research.,Environment,mu44-3ky4,
